# python-api
I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I  utilizing a simple Python library, OpenWeatherMap API, to create a representative model of weather across cities globally.
With the Open Weather API data, I was able use the data along with the Gmaps API to create heatmaps with hotel markers for the ideal vacation spots, narrowing down the cities to:
 
  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.
